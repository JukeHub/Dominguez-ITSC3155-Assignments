# Assignment1

I committed my assignment #1 on time. However, I noticed the video in the following module for how to set up one repository for all assignments today, 4 days later. 

https://instructure.charlotte.edu/courses/256568/files/31391197?module_item_id=7511070

I'll let this repo as is until my first assignment is graded, then I will follow the above video and fix this repo to house all my assignments, included the first assignment. 

Thanks!
